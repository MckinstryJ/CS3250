# CS3250
Semester long team folder for CS3250

<ol>Ideas for Sprint 4:
	<li> Nick, Chris, and Diego => create enough tests to meet a >95% test coverage. Make sure Travis CI/Code Climate/Checkstyle and any other forms of testing work for the project at all times.
	<li>Joel => Meet with customer, create cards, create ppt, help with project whenever possible
	<li>John => Complete cards beyond testing/ppt
</ol>

The idea being, the three of you have a lot to do outside of class so a three man team for the most important part should be enough to complete the task...and I don't mind completing the cards beyond testing/ppt. Obviously there won't be anything to test until I have completed a card but you should have something to test before the first weekend. (beyond the things we need to test from Sprint 1/2/3)

Cool?
